        <h3>Information:</h3>
        <p>ArtBASIC is an interpreted, BASIC inspired programming language written in Python Programming Language.</p>
        <p>This is just a prerelease version of ArtBASIC. It may have bugs or glitches and it's incomplete.</p>

    <div id="features">
        <h3>Features:</h3>
        <p>PRINT "" or '' -> string / (variable) / 1 + 2 / a + b - Prints a string in the screen. The 'PRINT' function can also be used to print the value of a math problem (like: PRINT 2 + 1) and also the value and can evaluate two or more variable values together, for example: PRINT a + b.</p>
        <p>LET (variable name) = (value) -> string, integer or float / 1 + 2 / a + b - Creates a new variable with a value that can be a string, integer or float.</p>
        <p>FOREVER: - It brings you in a forever loop where you can type code and it will run forever. You need to type 'END' to exit the forever loop.</p>
        <p>INPUT (content) - Makes a new input where you can type anything you want and it prints things that you typed in that input</p>
        <p>DRAW rectangle: - Draws a rectangle on the screen.</p>
        <p>DRAW triangle: - Draws a triangle on the screen.</p>
        <p>DRAW circle: - Draws a circle on the screen.</p>
        <p># - With this, you can comment anything you want. For example: # This is a comment.</p>
        <p>FUNCTION (name of the function): - Makes a new function with the specified name.</p>
        <p>RUN (function or supported file): - Runs a function or file. The file should contain code that ArtBASIC can execute.</p>
